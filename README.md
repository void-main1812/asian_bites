# React-Native-Expo-Template

React-Native-Expo-Template is a starter project for building mobile apps using react-native and expo go. It integrates some of the latest technologies such as nativewind, moti animations and tailwind css to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

## Features

- React-native: A framework for building native apps using React.
- Expo go: A tool that allows you to run your app on your phone without installing any native dependencies or setting up a development environment.
- Nativewind: A library that brings the power and simplicity of Tailwind CSS to React Native.
- Moti: A library that makes it easy to create animations in React Native using the Reanimated 2 API.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of customizable classes for styling your elements.

## Installation

To use this template, you need to have Node.js, npm and expo-cli installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions [here](^1^) to install them.

Then, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/void-main1812/Expo-Template.git
cd Expo-Template
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the app on your phone, you need to have the Expo Go app installed. You can download it from the [App Store](^2^) or [Google Play](^3^).

Then, you can start the app by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open a web page with a QR code. Scan the QR code with your phone camera or the Expo Go app and wait for the app to load.

You can also run the app on an emulator or simulator by following the instructions [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) .
